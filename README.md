This is my website where I plan to slowly learn how to make a website. 

Being a product owner by trade, I have decided to product manage this journey. 

## Phase 1
* Learn HTML
* Learn CSS
Goal: make the website entirely out of HTMl and CSS

## Phase 2
* How should I do the database?

## Phase 3
* Make the website in react
