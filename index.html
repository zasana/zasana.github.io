            <p>I studied computer science at Singapore University of Technology and Design, doing front-end for Android and iOS projects and focused on UI/UX. </p>
            <p>Currently working at Singtel as a management associate for the past 1.5 years where I had the chance to be the product manager of web at HOOQ and now a product development manager at Singtel CAST. </p>
            <p>Somehow, I ended up being the owner OTT video streaming products and working on analytics services from Google - Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Firebase Analytics, Data Studio and Big Query.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I like to work on my herb garden. Trying to grow my garden into an edible one.</p>
